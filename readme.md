API to implement facial recognition using [AWS Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/)

Most of the [Storage-based API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/how-it-works-storage-non-storage.html#how-it-works-storage-based) are exposed as API methods, except for SearcFace, DeleteFace and DescribeCollection.

Methods for managing collections, indexing and detecting faces from images in collections are implemented.
